## About Me

I'm a vulnerability researcher by trade. I love to **fuzz** things and shake out bugs.
Teaching, mentoring, and collaborating with others is my passion. 
In my free time I love to read and play with my incredibly smart corgi.

You'll usually find me coding in **Python** or **C**, though I dabble in Ruby and Swift.
I occasionally post articles on my [website](https://www.seandeaton.com) and on
[Medium](https://whatthefuzz.medium.com/).

## I've Helped to Secure a Few OSS Projects

- [crasm](https://github.com/colinbourassa/crasm/pull/7])
- [aspic](https://github.com/PhilipHazel/aspic/issues/1)
- [pcre2](https://github.com/PCRE2Project/pcre2/issues/196)

Type hinting is the best thing that happened to Python.
