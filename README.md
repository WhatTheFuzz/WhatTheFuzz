## About Me

I'm a vulnerability researcher by trade. I love to **fuzz** things and shake out bugs.
Teaching, mentoring, and collaborating with others is my passion. 
In my free time I love to read, lift, and play with my corgi.

You'll usually find me coding in **Python** or **C**, though I dabble in Ruby and Swift.
I occasionally post articles on my [website](https://www.seandeaton.com) and on
[Medium](https://whatthefuzz.medium.com/).
